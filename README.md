# I decided to learn C++

After my experience with Javascript, Python, and other languages, I want to try something new. So I decided to learn C++.

<br>

## My Plan
I want to make:
- [ ] A platformer game
- [ ] An infinite scroller game
- [ ] A posture check app

And I'll probably come up with more projects along the way...

<br>

### Will I ever seriously use this language?
Probably not.
### Will it spice up my resume?
Hopefully.
### Will it be fun?
Absolutely!
